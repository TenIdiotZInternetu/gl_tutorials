W - zoom  
S - unzoom  
A - move camera left  
D - move camera right  

Q - toggle diffuse colors  
E - toggle SSAO  

This is an implementation of SSAO shader. I followed this [guide](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/SSAO).
Alternative version without using the noise texture, is in the branch no-noise. While technically not correct, it produces less artefacts.
